Simple application for jailbroken iphones that blocks incoming calls based on a list of regex patterns to test against the caller number.

BUILD

./make

Might need to edit the makefile so sysroot matches the iPhone SDK installed.

RUN

Upload bin/callblocker to iPhone along with a file called blocklist, which has a list of regex patterns to match against the incoming numbers. The file is loaded from the current working directory of the application.

Example for a blocklist file which blocks all numbers that start with +54341681:

^\+54341681

You can run the application on the background using ssh like this:

./callblocker > out.log 2> error.log < /dev/null &

This is working for me on a jailbroken iPhone with iOS 6.1. It shows the call screen but closes it immediately.
